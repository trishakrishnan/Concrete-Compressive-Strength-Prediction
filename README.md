# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
Explore feature engineering and model tuning techniques to build an ML model for regression

# Problem Context:

The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) is the most important measure of performance used by civil engineers while designing and building structures
The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate

The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).
